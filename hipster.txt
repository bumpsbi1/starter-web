Git is a version control system (VCS) - maybe you heard of others before, like SVN or CVS. A VCS keeps track of all changes made to a repository and adds information such as who changed it and when. Revisions can then be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. What is special about Git, is that it doesn't need a remote server to host a repository. Git can be used locally, where it just keeps track of the changes you make to a folder. It also can be used as distributed VCS, so that code is hosted in different locations similar to a peer-to-peer system. Or you can choose to use it like other VCS as a server-client setup, in that case you just choose one of the hosts to act as a server. The latter is the case when you work with GitHub: You let GitHub host your project, while one or more contributors work on it locally and push changes back to the central repo on GitHub. Now let's get our hands dirty. And, as a reminder: don't hesitate to call out to your coaches for help.
